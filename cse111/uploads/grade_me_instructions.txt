The compilation of grade_me:
1. Download grade_me.cpp from UCMCROPS to your home directory (~/).
2. Copy the file to your home directory at engapps00 using the rsync command:
	rsync -avz ~/grade_me.cpp UCM_ID@engapps00:~/
3. Log in to engapps00 machine:
	ssh UCM_ID@engapps00
4. compile grade_me.cpp:
	g++ -o grade_me grade_me.cpp

This should be done only once during the whole course. Once you have grade_me binary up and running, you can use it for all the assignments.
 
To check your assignment:
1. Assume that you want to check your code for the assignment #0 and you source code is located in the file ass0.cpp at your home directory(~/).
2. Copy your cpp (or binary) file to engapps00:
 	rsync -avz ~/ass0.cpp UCM_ID@engapps00:~/
3. Log in to engapps00 machine:
	ssh UCM_ID@engapps00
4. compile ass0.cpp:
	g++ -o ass0 ass0.cpp
5. check the code with grade_me. 
	./grade_me 0 ass0


For the future assignments, just substitute 0 in the first argument of grade_me with the assignment's number.

Once you have passed the grade_me test successfully, show it to TA in order to receive a credit for the lab!

If you work directly on engapps00 machine (using e.g. vim or nano editor) in order to check your code you need to perform only two final steps.

Note, that if you want to assess your engapps00 account off-campus, you need to provide its full domain name (i.e. engapps00.ucmerced.edu instead of engapps00).
